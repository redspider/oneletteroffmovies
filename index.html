                <p>
                    Twitter is pretty crazy at the best of times, and at some point someone started playing a game, posting movie names with one letter changed, added or removed. No doubt this kind of thing happens regularly, but for some reason it has taken off like mad, and every man, woman, child and lolcat is busy posting these movie names at the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started reading them, like lots of people, and some of them were pretty funny - but like everything there was a lot of chaff as well and I wished I had a "best of" button on my twitter client. Then I figured, well, people seem to RT or at least re-invent a lot of the better ones, so maybe just counting popularity is sufficient. A couple of python scripts, a virtual host and some CSS repurposing later and here you have it, a site which is mostly working. I'm busy trying to figure out how to make this stuff work better. If you're on freenode, come chat in #oneletteroffmovies and make some suggestions.
